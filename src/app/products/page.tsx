            <h3>What We Make</h3>
            <p>
              Oceanflo produces packaged drinking water with full FSSAI and ISO
              compliance. We keep our product line focused on what dealers and
              customers actually need.

            <h3>Mineral Water Bottles</h3>

            <h4>1L Mineral Water Bottles</h4>
            <p>
              Our 1-liter bottles are perfect for families and general
              consumption. These contain natural minerals without alkaline
              enhancement. Great for home use, small offices, and retail sales
              where customers want larger quantities.
            </p>

            <h4>500ml Mineral Water Bottles</h4>
            <p>
              The 500ml size works well for personal use and retail sales. Easy
              to carry, fits in bags, and appeals to customers who want portion
              control. These also contain natural minerals without alkaline
              enhancement.

            <h3>Alkaline Water Jars</h3>

            <h4>20L Alkaline Water Jars</h4>
            <p>
              These large jars are designed for offices, businesses, and homes
              with water dispensers. Unlike our mineral water bottles, these
              jars contain alkaline water for customers who specifically want
              that option. Perfect for workplaces and families with higher water
              consumption.
